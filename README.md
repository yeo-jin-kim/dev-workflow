# dev-workflow

Independent local development orchestration. Target repositories do not import
or depend on this repository. Python 3.9+ on macOS/Linux; standard library only.

## Usage

Run from this repository (the script resolves defaults from its own location):

```sh
python3 tools/development_loop.py status --project projects/cora.json
python3 tools/development_loop.py run --project projects/cora.json --max-cycles 3 --total-seconds 1800
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q
```

`run` invokes the installed/authenticated Codex CLI and executes trusted contract
checks in the target checkout. Default model settings are preserved. The default
CoRA task is the prepared F1 contract; it has NOT been started by this migration.
`pilot.json` is historical, not the current default.

## Layout

- `tools/`: project-independent runner.
- `schemas/`: worker/reviewer output contracts.
- `projects/`: target root and project-specific policy/decision references.
- `contracts/<project>/`: approved goal, scope, checks, acceptance criteria.
- `.local/runs/`: durable state, subprocess logs, check and review results (ignored).
- `.local/archive/`: original historical run artifacts and migration checksums (ignored).
- `docs/implementation.md`: behavior, verification and remaining limitations.

Project root paths are relative to this repository unless absolute. Check command
arguments run relative to the target root. The project policy and decision paths
are target-relative. Add another project configuration/contract without importing
its source code into the controller. A contract cannot redefine the mandatory
`documentation_sync` review criterion. Missing/failed evidence blocks completion.

The worker uses the target as its workspace-write root; the separate reviewer
uses read-only mode. Schemas, contracts and output files are controller-owned.
Locks cover target identity across milestone runs. Target/controller trees must
be disjoint, and state must remain external. Reusing state after target or
controller changes is rejected; start a new state directory. Human decisions
remain pending until explicitly resolved in a new contract/state directory.

## Boundaries and limitations

This is path/ownership separation plus CLI workspace sandboxing, not a proof of
OS-level isolation. Local checks execute with the controller user's permissions;
use trusted checks. Protect the controller from target scripts, symlink attacks,
and arbitrary external commands with stronger OS/CI isolation before unattended
operation. Target code cannot legitimately edit contracts, controller or logs.
Per-invocation time/cycle limits exist; monetary budgets, background scheduling,
notifications, next-goal selection and a dedicated approval UI are not implemented.
No merge/deploy/publish is automatically authorized.

The preserved archive is historical: original state files contain old absolute
paths. Do not resume them or rewrite their evidence. See migration.json.

## Prepared CoRA pilot contract

The F1 contract revision 2 is documented in
[the task brief](contracts/cora/F1-distance-decay.md). It contains explicit
implementation candidates, protected synthetic cases, completion evidence and
owner-decision boundaries. Synthetic semantic labels are proposed, not certified
empirical ground truth. The contract is prepared only; before a live run review
it and prepare an isolated target baseline/test environment. Current project
configuration has not been switched to an isolated checkout.

## Delivery publication policy

The owner requests commit/push after each delivery. The maintaining parent
performs finalization after checking results. Incomplete milestones are pushed
to dedicated branches with their failed/missing gates stated, never merged or
reported accepted merely because they were published. Private .local logs stay
excluded; implementation workers do not push during their runs.
